39 days. 626 contestants. ONE Survivor!

This is an app for fans of the hit TV show, Survivor. The goal is to use ReactJS to build a single-page application that gives users a lot of functionality:

- organizing the castaways into Tiers
- listing/sorting castaways by measurable stats
- browing through the castaways season by season
